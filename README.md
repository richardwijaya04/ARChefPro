Looking ahead, we plan to continue developing advanced features and expanding the recipe database to further enhance the user experience with ARChefProo cook. The app is designed to overcome limitations in traditional culinary education methods by presenting cooking tutorials that combine engaging visual elements with a practical learning experience. With ARChefPro, users can access recipes and cooking tutorials in a realistic 3D format, creating an inviting virtual environment to learn cooking in a more interactive and fun way. Through the “Scan Here” feature, users can easily access AR content by scanning the provided marker, opening the door to an exciting and educational culinary world.

ARChefPro brings an exciting cooking learning experience by providing step-by-step guided cooking tutorials in an augmented reality environment. Users are guided from the preparation stage to serving with the help of AR technology that presents visual clues directly in the user's real environment. Thus, users not only learn about the cooking process theoretically, but also engage directly in immersive and engaging cooking practices. In addition, ARChefPro also offers a feature to explore a collection of 3D models, including kitchen utensils, ingredients, and cooking techniques, which enriches users' learning experience by providing access to a wide range of varied learning materials.

Through the development of ARChefPro, we have proven the potential of Augmented Reality technology in enriching the cooking learning experience and overcoming the limitations of traditional culinary education approaches. User evaluation results show a very positive response to the app, with all aspects of the user experience receiving excellent ratings. As such, ARChefPro not only represents a breakthrough in the world of culinary education, but also promises continued innovation and progress in the culinary industry. Looking ahead, we plan to continue developing advanced features and expanding the recipe database to further enhance the user experience with ARChefPro.
